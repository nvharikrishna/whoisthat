# whoisthat
(Under Development)

This is a simple application which opens up Virtual Assistant upon on receiving push notification automatically and waits for you to say 'Who Is That'. If you say that, it will read out notification for you.

This is based on idea of [Real Virtual Assistant](https://medium.com/@nvharikrishna/real-virtual-assistant-my-thoughts-d6a64a21491d#.7flz6k347) which is something you doesn't have to wakeup and knows when it needs to pay attention to you.
